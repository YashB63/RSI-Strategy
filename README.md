# RSI-Strategy
RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a popular technical indicator used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market.

It measures the strength and momentum of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100. 

The RSI is typically calculated over a 14-day period, but this can be adjusted based on the trader's preferences and time frame.
